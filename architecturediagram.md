##Frontend/UI:

The user interface responsible for user interactions and initiating requests.
API Gateway:

Manages external and internal communication.
Responsible for authentication, request routing, and ensuring secure communication.
Java Microservices (MS1, MS2):

Implement business logic in Java using Spring Boot.
Interact with shared data stores and provide specific functionalities.
Node.js Microservices (MS1, MS2):

Implement business logic in Node.js using Express.js.
Communicate with shared data stores and handle external partner access.
Shared Data Stores:

Aurora (Relational DB):
A relational database for Java microservices.
DynamoDB (NoSQL DB):
A NoSQL database for Node.js microservices.
Redis (Cache DB):
Used for caching to improve performance.
MongoDB (Document DB):
A document database for specialized data storage needs.
Communication Patterns:
External Communication:

External partners and users communicate with the banking application through the API Gateway.
Internal Communication:

Microservices communicate with each other through the API Gateway.
Shared data stores facilitate data exchange between microservices.
Data Flow:
User Interaction:

Users interact with the frontend, initiating requests for banking operations.
API Gateway Processing:

API Gateway processes incoming requests, manages authentication, and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
Microservices Interaction:

Microservices interact with shared data stores (Aurora, DynamoDB, Redis, MongoDB) to retrieve or update data.
Data consistency is maintained through these interactions.
Security Measures:
Authentication and Authorization:

API Gateway manages authentication and authorization, ensuring secure communication.
Datastore Security:

Shared data stores are secured using encryption at rest and in transit.
Additional Considerations:
Caching:

Redis is used as a cache database to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data.
Scalability:

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of microservices and utilizing AWS services like Amazon Aurora Serverless.
Monitoring and Logging:

CloudWatch is used for monitoring, logging, and gaining insights into application performance.
This diagram provides an alternative representation of the architecture, emphasizing the relationships between services, data stores, and communication patterns within the microservices ecosystem.
