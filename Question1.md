### Frontend/UI:

The user interface responsible for user interactions and initiating requests.

### API Gateway:

Manages external and internal communication.
Responsible for authentication, request routing, and ensuring secure communication.

### Java Microservices (MS1, MS2):

Implement business logic in Java using Spring Boot.
Interact with shared data stores and provide specific functionalities.


### Node.js Microservices (MS1, MS2):

Implement business logic in Node.js using Express.js.
Communicate with shared data stores and handle external partner access.


### Shared Data Stores:

Aurora (Relational DB):
A relational database for Java microservices.
DynamoDB (NoSQL DB):
A NoSQL database for Node.js microservices.
Redis (Cache DB):
Used for caching to improve performance.
MongoDB (Document DB):
A document database for specialized data storage needs.
Communication Patterns:


### External Communication:

External partners and users communicate with the banking application through the API Gateway.
Internal Communication:

Microservices communicate with each other through the API Gateway.
Shared data stores facilitate data exchange between microservices.

### Data Flow:
User Interaction:

Users interact with the frontend, initiating requests for banking operations.
API Gateway Processing:

API Gateway processes incoming requests, manages authentication, and routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
Microservices Interaction:

Microservices interact with shared data stores (Aurora, DynamoDB, Redis, MongoDB) to retrieve or update data.
Data consistency is maintained through these interactions.
Security Measures:
Authentication and Authorization:

### API Gateway manages authentication and authorization, ensuring secure communication.


### Datastore Security:

Shared data stores are secured using encryption at rest and in transit.
Additional Considerations:
Caching:

Redis is used as a cache database to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data.
Scalability:

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances of microservices and utilizing AWS services like Amazon Aurora Serverless.
Monitoring and Logging:

CloudWatch is used for monitoring, logging, and gaining insights into application performance.

### API Gateway Explanation with Sample:

An API Gateway is a central component in a microservices architecture that serves as the entry point for managing and facilitating communication between various services. It plays a crucial role in handling external and internal communication by providing a unified interface for clients to interact with multiple microservices. Here's a breakdown of the key responsibilities of an API Gateway along with a sample scenario:

### External and Internal Communication Management:

Responsibility: API Gateway acts as a mediator for both external and internal communication, allowing clients to interact with microservices seamlessly. It abstracts the complexity of the underlying microservices architecture, presenting a unified API to external clients.
Sample Scenario: Consider a banking application with various microservices handling user accounts, transactions, and notifications. External clients, such as a mobile app or a third-party service, communicate with the banking application through the API Gateway. Internally, microservices communicate with each other through the same gateway.
Authentication:

Responsibility: API Gateway ensures that only authorized users or systems can access the microservices. It handles authentication by validating user credentials, API keys, or tokens before forwarding requests to the appropriate microservices.
Sample Scenario: When a user attempts to log in to the banking application, the API Gateway checks the provided credentials. If the credentials are valid, the request is allowed to proceed to the user authentication microservice. If not, the gateway denies access and returns an authentication error.
Request Routing:

Responsibility: API Gateway routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the request path, parameters, or headers. It serves as a traffic director, ensuring that each request is directed to the correct destination.
Sample Scenario: In the banking application, a request to retrieve user account information is sent to the API Gateway. The gateway inspects the request and forwards it to the user accounts microservice responsible for handling account-related operations.
Ensuring Secure Communication:

Responsibility: API Gateway enforces security measures to protect the communication between clients and microservices. This includes encrypting data in transit, preventing unauthorized access, and implementing security protocols.
Sample Scenario: All communication between the external client (e.g., mobile app) and the API Gateway is encrypted using HTTPS. The gateway also verifies the identity of the client through secure authentication mechanisms before allowing access to sensitive financial data.
